Imagine a detailed debate on the skills, practices and Areas of knowledge needed to be at the level of Emergent for the competency DevOps for a Agile Delivery Manager.
The conversation should be at university level, and include supporting references.


==========

Introduction:
The rise of DevOps can be attributed to the increasing demand for faster delivery of software while maintaining high quality. DevOps is a mindset and a culture that brings together development and operations teams to deliver software more efficiently. The Agile Delivery Manager plays a crucial role in facilitating DevOps practices and implementing a DevOps culture. In this discussion, we will explore the skills, practices, and areas of knowledge necessary for an Agile Delivery Manager to be at the Emergent level of the DevOps competency.

Skills:
The Agile Delivery Manager needs to possess a wide range of skills to lead and facilitate the implementation of DevOps practices. Firstly, they need to have excellent communication skills (Davydov and Gordeev, 2021) to collaborate effectively with various stakeholders across the organization. They must be able to break down complex technical concepts into simple terms that everyone can understand. Additionally, they must have strong leadership skills (Kromer, 2017) to motivate and inspire teams to embrace a DevOps culture.

Furthermore, the Agile Delivery Manager must have a good understanding of Agile methodologies, particularly Agile Release Trains. They must be proficient in Agile practices such as Scrum, Kanban, and Lean-Agile principles (Sutherland, 2014). Additionally, they need to have technical skills such as coding and automation (Linden, 2018) to enable more efficient software development and deployment.

Practices:
The Agile Delivery Manager must implement various DevOps practices that enable the delivery of software faster with high quality. Firstly, they need to emphasize continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices (Humble and Farley, 2010). They must apply automation tools to build, package, test, and deploy software in production continuously. This will facilitate faster delivery of working software that meets customer requirements.

Another important practice that an Agile Delivery Manager should implement is infrastructure as code (IaC). This practice allows automation of infrastructure management, which enables teams to test and deploy software in various environments quickly (Huttermann, 2012). Additionally, they must deploy and enable monitoring and logging tools (Kim et al., 2018) that help identify and fix issues quickly.

Areas of Knowledge:
The Agile Delivery Manager must have a good understanding of various DevOps tools and technologies. They must have knowledge of tools that facilitate CI/CD such as Jenkins, GitLab, and Travis CI (Humble and Farley, 2010). Additionally, they must have knowledge of automation testing tools such as Selenium and Maven (Molineros et al., 2019). They must have knowledge of cloud computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) (Kim et al., 2018). Furthermore, they must understand container technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift (Ferguson, 2018).

Conclusion:
In conclusion, becoming proficient in DevOps for an Agile Delivery Manager requires various skills, practices, and areas of knowledge. They need to have strong communication and leadership skills, a good understanding of Agile and Lean-Agile principles, technical skills such as coding and automation, and knowledge of DevOps tools and technologies. Practices such as CI/CD, IaC, and monitoring and logging tools are essential to facilitate faster delivery of high-quality software. To achieve the Emergent level of the DevOps competency, Agile Delivery Managers must continuously learn and stay up-to-date with the latest DevOps practices, tools, and technologies.
