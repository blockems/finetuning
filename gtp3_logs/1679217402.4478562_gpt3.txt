Agile coaching and program management expert:

To be an expert in the DevOps Toolchain for a CI/CD Lead, an individual must possess a wide range of knowledge and skills. In this discussion, we will explore the skills, practices and areas of knowledge needed to become an expert in DevOps Toolchain for a CI/CD Lead.

Skills:
One of the core skills for an expert in DevOps Toolchain is knowledge of multiple programming languages, as they can be used to write scripts which automate recurring deployment or operational tasks. An expert should also possess an in-depth knowledge of the tools used in DevOps environments such as: Jenkins, Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Gitlab CI, Travis CI, CircleCI and others. Other essential skills include effective communication, team management, and experience in agile methodologies, including Scrum or Kanban.

With these skills in mind, we can move on to the practices necessary for an expert in DevOps toolchain.

Practices:
An expert in DevOps Toolchain will need to demonstrate expertise in several key practices. Firstly, they must be able to identify process inefficiencies and bottlenecks in the deployment cycle, and design solutions to address those inefficiencies. This will require them to be proficient in various testing paradigms, including automated testing and continuous integration.

In addition, a DevOps Toolchain expert should have the ability to effectively utilize containerization technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes or Openshift to achieve continuous delivery. They should also be able to advocate and implement Agile and DevOps practices that focus on collaboration, automation, and feedback.

Areas of Knowledge:
