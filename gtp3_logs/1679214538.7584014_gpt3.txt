==========

Agile Delivery Managers are responsible for overall delivery management of projects and programs using agile methodologies. One of the key competencies required for an Agile Delivery Manager is negotiation. Negotiation involves effective communication, understanding stakeholders' needs, and finding common ground to come to an agreement that benefits all parties involved. 

To be a competent negotiator as an Agile Delivery Manager, there are several skills, practices, and areas of knowledge that need to be understood and applied. Firstly, the Agile Delivery Manager needs to have excellent communication skills, both verbally and in writing. They must be able to articulate their thoughts, listen actively to others, and be able to express themselves in a clear and concise manner. This can be achieved through active listening, clarifying the message, and presenting information in a manner that is easy to understand for all stakeholders involved. 

Secondly, the Agile Delivery Manager must have a good understanding of the negotiation process. This involves understanding the stages of negotiation, negotiation techniques, and the various outcomes that can be achieved. The Agile Delivery Manager must be able to set clear goals for negotiation, identify any roadblocks or barriers to success, and be able to develop strategies to overcome any obstacles. 

Thirdly, the Agile Delivery Manager must have good emotional intelligence. They must be able to read and understand the emotions of others, manage their own emotions, and be able to use emotional intelligence to facilitate communication during negotiation. By understanding the emotions of others involved in the negotiation process, the Agile Delivery Manager can tailor their communication and negotiation style to better achieve their goals. 

Fourthly, the Agile Delivery Manager must be aware of the cultural differences that may exist between different stakeholders involved in the negotiation process. This includes understanding the different cultural norms, communication styles, and decision-making processes that may exist. By being aware of these cultural differences, the Agile Delivery Manager can adjust their negotiation style to be more effective and achieve better outcomes. 

Finally, the Agile Delivery Manager must be able to apply their knowledge of negotiation to agile methodologies. This includes understanding how to negotiate in an iterative and incremental manner, focusing on outcomes rather than outputs, and using collaborative negotiation techniques.
