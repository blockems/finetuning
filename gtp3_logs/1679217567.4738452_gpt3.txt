3) Version Control: Familiarity with version control systems (VCS) such as Git, and how to use them to manage changes, releases, and versioning.

5) Release Planning and Coordination: The ability to work with project management teams and other stakeholders to coordinate release schedules and to ensure that all necessary dependencies are managed effectively. Knowledge of Agile methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, is also beneficial in this regard.
